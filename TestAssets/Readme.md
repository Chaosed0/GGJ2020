 - Keep "Clean" in the state you want the final build to be in
 - Copy "Clean" and rename it into "Dirty" in this directory for your in-editor testing
 - "Dirty" is already gitignore'd! Feel free to throw whatever you want in here.
 - "Clean" gets automatically copied to the right place for any builds.
